I'm a CIHR-funded postdoctoral researcher currently based at the Brain and Mind Institute (University of Western Ontario). My current work focuses on using a combination of fMRI and EEG to study auditory, and specifically speech processing in humans.

My doctoral studies were completed at Cardiff University under the supervision of Professor David Whitaker and explored sensory time perception in humans and the extent to which these adhere to distributed mechanisms of processing. My undergraduate studies were completed at the University of Nottingham (UK).

My work has been supported by several funding awards, and I have reviewed for journals such as PloS ONE, Experimental Brain Research, Frontiers in Psychology and Psychology and Behavioral Sciences.
